# Cognisync

**Cognisync** is a visionary real-time AI thought debugger designed for AI engineers, researchers, and system architects who seek to bridge the interpretability gap in modern AI systems.

## Vision

To empower developers with tools that allow real-time tracing, visualization, and guided intervention during model inference — unlocking a new era of transparent and accountable AI.

## What It Does

- **Trace & Visualize**: See the internal reasoning flow of the model during inference
- **Intervene**: Pause and alter the thought path in real time
- **Understand**: Connect neural decisions with human logic for alignment and safety

## Why It Matters

Black-box AI is risky. Cognisync aims to bring AI behavior into the light — making advanced systems more understandable, teachable, and controllable.
